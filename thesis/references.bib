  abstract = {PD-1 is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells. Mice deficient in PD-1 exhibit a breakdown of peripheral tolerance and demonstrate multiple autoimmune features. We report here that the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) is a member of the B7 gene family. Engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1 leads to the inhibition of T cell receptor–mediated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion. In addition, PD-1 signaling can inhibit at least suboptimal levels of CD28-mediated costimulation. PD-L1 is expressed by antigen-presenting cells, including human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with interferon γ, and activated human and murine dendritic cells. In addition, PD-L1 is expressed in nonlymphoid tissues such as heart and lung. The relative levels of inhibitory PD-L1 and costimulatory B7-1/B7-2 signals on antigen-presenting cells may determine the extent of T cell activation and consequently the threshold between tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-L1 expression on nonlymphoid tissues and its potential interaction with PD-1 may subsequently determine the extent of immune responses at sites of inflammation.},

Considering both breast and ovarian cancers being hormonally driven and sharing multiple risk factors, we performed this case-control study to evaluate the association between APOBEC3 deletion and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. We analyzed the APOBEC3 deletion in a case-control study of 2,938 Chinese women (including 1,374 EOC cases and 1,564 healthy controls). All participants were genotyped using real-time qualitative PCR (qPCR). APOBEC3 deletion was significant associated with EOC risk, with ORs (95 \% CIs) of 1.46 (1.14-1.86) associated with one copy deletion and 2.53 (0.91-7.06) associated with two copy deletion compared with subjects with no deletion (P for trend =1.50\,×\,10(-3)). Additional adjustments and stratified analyses did not change the results materially. Our data suggests that the loss genotypes of APOBEC3 deletion predispose their carriers to EOC.},

This paper provides a characterization of its interaction network, studying the political leaning, polarization, network structure, and algorithmic curation mechanisms of five million users. The dataset spans from the website’s first release in February of 2023 to May of 2024. We investigate the replies, likes, reposts, and follows layers of the Bluesky network. We find that all networks are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions, high clustering, and short connection paths, similar to other larger social networks. BlueSky introduced feeds—algorithmic content recommenders created for and by users. We analyze all feeds and find that while a large number of custom feeds have been created, users’ uptake of them appears to be limited. We analyze the hyperlinks shared by BlueSky’s users and find no evidence of polarization in terms of the political leaning of the news sources they share. They share predominantly left-center news sources and little to no links associated with questionable news sources. In contrast to the homogeneous political ideology, we find significant issues-based divergence by studying opinions related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Two clear homophilic clusters emerge: Pro-Palestinian voices outnumber pro-Israeli users, and the proportion has increased. We conclude by claiming that Bluesky—for all its novel features—is very similar in its network structure to existing and larger social media sites and provides unprecedented research opportunities for social scientists, network scientists, and political scientists alike.},

  abstract = {The APOBEC3 family of cytosine deaminases catalyzes the conversion of cytosines-to-uracils in single-stranded DNA. Traditionally, these enzymes are associated with antiviral immunity and restriction of DNA-based pathogens. However, a role for these enzymes in tumor evolution and metastatic disease has also become evident. The primary APOBEC3 candidate in cancer mutagenesis is APOBEC3B (A3B) for three reasons: (1) A3B mRNA is upregulated in several different cancers, (2) A3B expression and mutational loads correlate with poor clinical outcomes, and (3) A3B is the only family member known to be constitutively nuclear. Previous studies have mapped non-canonical A3B nuclear localization determinants to a single surface-exposed patch within the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we show that A3B has an additional, distinct, surface-exposed NTD region that contributes to nuclear localization. Disruption of residues within the first 30 amino acids of A3B (import surface 1) or loop 5/α-helix 3 (import surface 2) completely abolish nuclear localization. These import determinants also graft into NTDs of related family members and mediate re-localization from cell-wide-to-nucleus or cytoplasm-to-nucleus. These findings demonstrate that both sets of residues are required for non-canonical A3B nuclear localization and describe unique surfaces that may serve as novel therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: BRAF mutations are present in two thirds of cutaneous melanomas and many of the rest have NRAS mutations. However, cutaneous melanoma is a heterogeneous disease with many clinicopathologic subtypes. Of these, the majority fits into four categories: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM). Thus far, there is very limited data combining BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis to explore differences between cutaneous melanoma subtypes. The aim of this study was to address this issue. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The frequency of BRAF and NRAS hotspot mutations, in exons 15 and 2, respectively, was assessed in 59 cutaneous melanomas comprising superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and ALM using single-strand conformational polymorphism and RFLP-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Only 2 of 21 (9.5\%) ALM showed BRAF exon 15 mutation compared with 9 of 14 (64.3\%) superficial spreading malignant melanomas, 4 of 11 (36.4\%) nodular melanomas, and 7 of 13 (53.4\%) lentigo maligna melanomas (P {$<$} 0.01). However, our key finding is that the combined analysis of BRAF exon 15 and NRAS exon 2 showed that there were no significant differences in the overall mutation frequency between subtypes. In particular, 9 of 19 (47.4\%) ALM without BRAF exon 15 mutation had an NRAS exon 2 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the overall BRAF/NRAS frequency in mutation hotspots is not significantly different among cutaneous melanoma subtypes. These data show that mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation may be important in all major subtypes of cutaneous melanoma, although the mechanism by which this is achieved varies.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Although most cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) are easily cured with surgery or ablation, a subset of these tumors recur, metastasize, and cause death. We conducted the largest study of CSCC outcomes since 1968. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors independently associated with poor outcomes in primary CSCC. DESIGN: A 10-year retrospective cohort study. SETTING: An academic hospital in Boston. PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred eighty-five patients with 1832 tumors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subhazard ratios for local recurrence, nodal metastasis, disease-specific death, and all-cause death adjusted for presence of known prognostic risk factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 50 (range, 2-142) months. Local recurrence occurred in 45 patients (4.6\%) during the study period; 36 (3.7\%) developed nodal metastases; and 21 (2.1\%) died of CSCC. In multivariate competing risk analyses, independent predictors for nodal metastasis and disease-specific death were a tumor diameter of at least 2 cm (subhazard ratios, 7.0 [95\% CI, 2.2-21.6] and 15.9 [4.8-52.3], respectively), poor differentiation (6.1 [2.5-14.9] and 6.7 [2.7-16.5], respectively), invasion beyond fat (9.3 [2.8-31.1] and 13.0 [4.3-40.0], respectively), and ear or temple location (3.8 [1.1-13.4] and 5.9 [1.3-26.7], respectively). Perineural invasion was also associated with disease-specific death (subhazard ratio, 3.6 [95\% CI, 1.1-12.0]), as was anogenital location, but few cases were anogenital. Overall death was associated with poor differentiation (subhazard ratio, 1.3 [95\% CI, 1.1-1.6]) and invasion beyond fat (1.7 [1.1-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma carries a low but significant risk of metastasis and death. In this study, patients with CSCC had a 3.7\% risk of metastasis and 2.1\% risk of disease-specific death. Tumor diameter of at least 2 cm, invasion beyond fat, poor differentiation, perineural invasion, and ear, temple, or anogenital location were risk factors associated with poor outcomes. Accurate risk estimation of outcomes from population-based data and clinical trials proving the utility of disease-staging modalities and adjuvant therapy is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is a common skin disease whose incidence and mortality rates have been showing yearly increases. In this report, we update the most recent data on skin cancer as obtained from GLOBOCAN 2022. METHODS: The incidence and mortality rates of skin cancer (melanoma of skin and non-melanoma skin cancer) in GLOBOCAN 2022 were reviewed. These data were analyzed and the characteristics of incidence and mortality across five continents and top five countries and regions in each continent are presented. In addition, correlations between Human Development Index (HDI) and age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of these two skin cancers are described. RESULTS: The GLOBOCAN 2022~data indicated that melanoma was the 17th most common cancer. An estimated 331,722 people were diagnosed with melanoma globally and approximately 58,667~died from this disease. For non-melanoma skin cancer, it ranks as the 5th most common cancer, and an estimated 1,234,533 people were diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer globally and approximately 69,416~died from this disease. The incidence of skin cancer varies across geographic regions and countries, with a predominance observed in Oceania, North America, and Europe. Australia was ranked first in terms of incidence, while incidence rates in Africa and Asia were very low. Despite these regional differences in incidence, there was little geographic variation in mortality rates. Currently, the number of deaths from non-melanoma skin cancer exceeds that of melanoma of skin. HDI was positively associated with the incidence of both types of skin cancers, with a positive correlation obtained between HDI and mortality from melanoma of skin and a negative correlation between HDI and mortality from non-melanoma skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Skin cancer remains a major disease burden worldwide. Substantial variations are observed across countries and regions. Further research on skin cancer will be required to provide a rationale for more effective preventions and treatments of this condition.},

  abstract = {Copy number variations occur frequently in the genome and are a significant source of human genetic variation accounting for disease. Recently, we discovered a common deletion located in the APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B genes significantly associated with breast cancer in Chinese women. Investigating this locus in other populations would be an expedient way to evaluate the generalizability of the novel finding. We analyzed the APOBEC3 deletion in a large study of 3273 European-ancestry women (including 1671 breast cancer cases and 1602 controls) from the population-based Nashville Breast Health Study. All participants were genotyped using real-time qualitative PCR. Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between the deletion polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The APOBEC3 deletion was observed in 12.4\% of cases and 10.4\% of controls. The deletion was significantly associated with breast cancer risk, with ORs and 95\% CIs of 1.21 (1.02-1.43) associated with one-copy deletion and 2.29 (1.04-5.06) associated with two-copy deletion compared with women with no deletion (P for trend = 0.005). The positive association of the APOBEC3 deletion with breast cancer risk was similar for estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer and was not modified by known breast cancer risk factors. Results from this study confirmed the association of the APOBEC3 deletion with breast cancer risk among women of European ancestry.},
